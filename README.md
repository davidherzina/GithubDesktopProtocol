# Safari extension for Github Desktop

This Safari extension is used to repair the "Open in Desktop" link on Github. The extension is based on the script (https://github.com/landonth/github-desktop-protocol-fix), which unfortunately does not work in Safari.

## Installation

Double-click on prepared extension ```Build/GithubDesktopProtocol.safariextz```.
